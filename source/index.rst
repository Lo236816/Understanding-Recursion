Understanding Recursion Using Python
====================================

**A shamelessly verbose guide to the wonders of recursion**


Getting Started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a guide for beginning and perhaps intermediate programmers for understanding how recursion actually works. It uses Python 3.6 but the universal presence of recursion should make this broadly applicable. The idea is to provide a framework for how to 'think recursively' when confronted with problems that demand (or simply favor) recursive solutions. 

Sometimes I'll present the code immediately, and proceed to unpack it. Other times, we'll work towards the final recursive solution starting only from first principles. At the end of each section I deduce a few heuristics, and include an exercise or two that will apply the material and push comprehension a bit further.
